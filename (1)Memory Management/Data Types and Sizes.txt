								Data Types and Sizes


1. char: Typically 1 byte (8 bits).

2. int: Typically 4 bytes (32 bits).

3. float: Typically 4 bytes (32 bits).

4. double: Typically 8 bytes (64 bits).

5. short int (short): Typically 2 bytes (16 bits).

6. long int (long): Typically 4 bytes (32 bits) or 8 bytes (64 bits) depending on the system.
 
7. long long int: Typically 8 bytes (64 bits).

8. unsigned int: Typically 4 bytes (32 bits).

9. unsigned char: Typically 1 byte (8 bits).

10. unsigned short int: Typically 2 bytes (16 bits).

11. unsigned long int: Typically 4 bytes (32 bits) or 8 bytes (64 bits) depending on the system.

12. unsigned long long int: Typically 8 bytes (64 bits).

13. Pointer: The size of a pointer can depend on the system architecture. It's usually 4 bytes (32 bits) on 32-bit systems and 8 bytes (64 bits) on 64-bit systems.

14. Enum: The size of an enum can vary depending on the compiler, but it's often the same size as an int.

15. Boolean (bool): Typically 1 byte, but it can vary depending on the compiler and system.

16. Structs and Unions: The size of structs and unions is determined by the sum of the sizes of their individual members, with padding added for alignment. It can vary widely based on the specific structure of the data.



Note:
	Data types and their sizes can vary depending on the programming language and the system architecture being used.These sizes are not fixed and can vary on different systems and 	compilers.
